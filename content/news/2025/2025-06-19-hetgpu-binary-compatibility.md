Heterogeneous GPU infrastructures present a binary compatibility challenge: code 
compiled for one vendorâ€™s GPU will not run on another due to divergent instruction sets, 
execution models, and driver stacks. This article proposes  hetGPU, a new system comprising 
a compiler, runtime, and abstraction layer that together enable a single GPU binary to execute 
on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Tenstorrent hardware. Featuring SYCL.
