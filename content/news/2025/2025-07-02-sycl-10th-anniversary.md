Codeplay is celebrating the 10th anniversary of SYCL™ and taking time to reflect on the progress obtained in the last decade. SYCL is an open, standards-based abstraction layer that empowers developers to take advantage of diverse hardware architectures. Whether CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or new and innovative AI accelerators, developers can write their application with SYCL and run it simultaneously across their hardware without the need for long, complex porting efforts and the maintenance of multiple software stacks.

Members of Codeplay Software share applications of SYCL™  and their own experiences of watching SYCL evolve over the decade.
