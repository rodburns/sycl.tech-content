In computational fluid dynamics, the Lattice Boltzmann method is a computational 
technique that has gained popularity due to its flexibility in handling complex 
geometries and turbulence models, and its unique suitability for massive parallel 
processing. This article introduces miniLB, to the best of our knowledge the first 
SYCL-based mini-application for the Lattice Boltzmann method.
