The open-source DPC++ compiler recently gained support for compiling SYCL source code
at runtime using the kernel_compiler extension. The feature is also available in the 2025.2 
release of Intel’s oneAPI distribution. This blog post explores how applications can leverage 
runtime compilation as a powerful addition to SYCL’s toolbox for kernel specialisation by C++ metaprogramming.
