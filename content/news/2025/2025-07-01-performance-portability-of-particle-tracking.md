With fast advancements in detector and software technologies used in large-scale
physics experiments, the requirements for the performance of computing systems used 
for both online and offline data processing have grown drastically.

This paper presents the application of the SYCL heterogeneous programming model
that can help overcome those drawbacks. By the introduction of an abstraction layer, 
the source code is decoupled from the computing device architecture, and the developer 
can select the compilation target.
